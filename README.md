# Deepfake-Detection
This project focuses on detecting deepfake media using the Meso4 model, a specialized convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for facial forgery detection. Deepfakes are synthetic images or videos generated by advanced neural networks that closely mimic real content, posing significant challenges for media authenticity.
